When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there are more than one people working on a project or else if there is a need to
  run the code in many computers its better to have the code at a centralized place that
  is accesable from every where there is internet access with proper authentication rather 
  than at a local place. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	The answer will be similar to why there should be manual push/ commit. Human decision
	making is much better than AI brains.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are used to clone someones else project onto the github, it is similar 
	to git clone but the only differnece is that it is done on the git hud website.
	Clone is used to move or download a project from the repository on github to the 
	local machine. Branches are made to keep different tracks of works separating 
	the working versions versus the other developing versions all having the same code
	and can be merged back to the main master branch after the work has been completed 
	successfully by using the merge command.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	By having the last known state of the remote stroed locally it is benefitted in the following way's:
	lets say we have made changes in the git hub and hence the master at the git hub is pointing else where 
	and we have also made changes to the local repo hence the origin/master and master point at different nodes
	by having the history of states we have a clear cut idea of positions if there is merge confilct between the
	two.

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	The computing power of the computer has given us another shortcut. It's the
	diff command using which we can easily comapre two files which are maintained
	using a version conytrol. Since detecting changes in a thousand lines of code 
	is very tidious process, we have this command we makes life much easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
	efficient programmer, this is totally true. We programmer have
	a great talent of fucking things up while coding, so hence by
	keeping older versions of code we can roll back whenever we fuck
	up.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The programmer knows when to exactly do the commit instead of it leaving it to
    a software or an AI to decide when to make a commit. The commit may be small or
    irrelevant when an AI makes a commit so it's better for the commit to be made 
    manually. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros of commiting manually is that the commit will be small, efficient and 
	relevant whereas the cons are that it is dependent on the operator. the operator 
	must remember to commit everytime he makes one logical change without forgetting.
	the pros and cons of the automatic commting xis viceversa of the manual commit  

When you've updated your document, click "Next", and an experienced Git user will share why version control is useful to him.

When you've updated your document, click "Next" and Sarah will go over another difference between version control systems.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    SInce I can revert back to the previous stable working protype mode by using the 
    version control system, I'm very confident of making changes since the changes that
    i do if fucks up the whole project i can simply revert back to previous commit aka 
    head using the git checkout. I feel a lot more confident about making changes to 
    my project hence forth.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

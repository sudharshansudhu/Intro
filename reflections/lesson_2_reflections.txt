What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	We need to initialise a repository to make it available for the git 
	to keep track of all the changes that we and may wish to revert back. We 
	can initialise a repository by the command
				git init

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The working stores all the files on the disc and are represented as such.
	Working directory may be thought of as a repository but it includes those
	files which are commited. The staging area can be thought of as a stage
	that stores all the files that are ready to be commited but not yet 
	commited. All the files in the staging area can be commited at once.To
	add files to staging area we use the command "git add fname"
